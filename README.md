### Development

#### Data Exploration
This is the stage where you have a scan of what’s in the data, errors, inconcsistencies, bugs, weird and corrupted characters etc. Steps taken at this stage:
- Get source data from client
- Exploring and analyzing data
- Cell formatting from Text/General to Number
- Rounding up values
- Extracting Channel Name from first column separated by ‘@’ symbol.

#### Data Cleaning
The aim is to refine our dataset to ensure it is structured and ready for analysis. Steps taken at this stage:
- Create new database – use database
- Import excel file
- Remove unnecessary columns (use SELECT statement)
- Extract YouTube channel names from first column (use CHARINDEX & SUBSTRING)
```sql
-- CHARINDEX
SELECT
	CHARINDEX('@', [NAME]), [NAME]
FROM
	[dbo].[youtube_data_canada]

-- SUBSTRING & CREATING VIEW FOR POWER BI
CREATE VIEW
	view_canada_youtube
AS SELECT 
	CAST(SUBSTRING([NAME], 1, CHARINDEX('@',[NAME])-1) AS varchar(100)) as 'Channel_Name',
	[Total_Subscriber],
	[Total_Views],
	[Total_Videos]
FROM
	[dbo].[youtube_data_canada]
```

- Rename the columns as applicable
- Create SQL view for Power BI

#### Data Quality Check
Steps taken at this stage:
- Row count test: at least 100 records required (Use COUNT)
```sql
-- Row Count Check
SELECT 
	COUNT(*) AS No_of_rows
FROM 
	[dbo].[view_canada_youtube]
```
  
- Column count test: at least 4 columns required (Use COUNT in INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS)
```sql
-- Column Count Check
SELECT 
	COUNT(*) AS No_of_cols 
FROM 
	INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE 
	TABLE_NAME = 'view_canada_youtube'
```

- Datatype check: Channel name must be string and other columns should be whole numbers (Use INFORMATION_SCHEMA)
```sql
-- Datatype Check
SELECT 
	COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE
FROM 
	INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE 
	TABLE_NAME = 'view_canada_youtube'
```

- Duplicate check: each record must be unique (Use COUNT, GROUP BY, HAVING)
```sql
-- Duplicate Check
SELECT 
	[Channel_Name],
	COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM 
	[dbo].[view_canada_youtube]
GROUP BY
	Channel_Name
HAVING
	COUNT(*) > 1

-- Another method to check duplicate
SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT [Channel_Name]) 
FROM 
	[dbo].[view_canada_youtube]
```
